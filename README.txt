Puncher

Puncher is a group project in Swift using CoreMotion, CoreLocation, AVFoundation, and MapKit. The project was written by Elliot Young, Sonny Tosca, Barak Ben-David and John Pham at the Coding Dojo in San Jose, CA.

The software takes its inspiration from Punch-Out!! which was initially released in 1987 and Sonny's real life experience to get in the ring without physical harm. The copyright to that work is held by Nintendo.

This is the original work of the team and produced in Swift language (released in 2013) in its entirety.

When you join the game you will see two boxing gloves and a punching bag. A start menu is located in the upper right corner in which you try to attain the highest score (located on the upper left corner) possible by hitting the punching bag in the time allotted.

There is a secret punching bag if you click in the middle. All messages, indirect and or directly, is for entertainment purposes and does not represent the political stance of any the team members.

To summarize the controls:

	Rotate your phone in order to throw a punch. The buttons below the punching bag allows another method to initiate punches. 

Features to be fixed

    Background image to be correctly displayed when in initially in portrait mode and later rotated to landscape.
